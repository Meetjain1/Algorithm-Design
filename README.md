# Algorithm Design 

## Overview

This repository contains the algorithm designs.

### Profile Discovery Engine

Designed to:

* Show user profiles strategically instead of randomly
* Balance between familiar (same university or degree) and diverse profiles
* Learn from user like/dislike patterns to improve recommendations
* Keep users engaged while maximising meaningful connections

### Group Dining Matcher

Designed to:

* Form balanced dinner groups of six people with compatible dietary, budget, and location constraints
* Create groups with complementary interests to encourage natural conversations
* Ensure fairness so every user gets equal opportunities for great experiences

## Approach

Both algorithms are designed to be:

* Scalable to 10,000+ users per city
* Fast, executing within 100ms
* Adaptable to learn and improve over time
* Fair and privacy-conscious

Detailed explanations, logic, trade-offs, and implementation plans are included in their respective files.
