# Algorithm Design - Executive Summary

## Project Overview

**Vision**: Building the next generation of social networking algorithms that create meaningful human connections through intelligent profile discovery and curated group dining experiences.

**Inspired by Industry Giants**: Our algorithms draw from the best practices of Instagram's Explore, Facebook's People You May Know, Hinge's Most Compatible, Timeleft's group formation, and Bumble BFF's social matching.
